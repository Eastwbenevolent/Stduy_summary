#Linked List

Definiton : It is a structure in which data is connected like a mini-franc sausage.

Each data occupies one node, and each data has a pointer, pointing to the memory address of the next data.

Connection lists and arrangements are both slightly different from data structures that line up data.

Connection lists are slow to access data, but they are fast to add and delete.
Arrays are fast to access data, but slow to add and delete.

Structures data by implementation methods such as Single Linked List / Double Linked List / Circular Linked List / Chunked List.
